            <p> <span class="top-highlight">Hi</span>, <br> I am <span class="highlight">Sajib Barua</span>. Now, I am struggling to be a web developer. On the field of web development, I am definitely a beginner now. I was started learning <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> few days ago. But programming is not a new thing for me. I know something about <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>Python</b>. From these three languages, I know well about C and C++. I also done very little <b>Competitive Programming</b> before. Making a professional website is one of my dream.</p>

            <p> <span class="top-highlight">My Dreams</span>, <br> Actually I have a lot of dream. To become a full-stack web developer is one of them. I know it's not an easy task. But I will do my best to fulfill this dream. I have a huge interest in the field of Cyber Security. It is the main issue to learn web development for me. But my next target is not jump into Cyber Security. After learning basic of the web development, I will jump into app development. To clear my basic on this field. Than there is no issue I think to jump into the Cyber Security. The journey to cyber security is not be smooth always. But I will make it happen. Because now, I know the pain of a broken dream!</p>
